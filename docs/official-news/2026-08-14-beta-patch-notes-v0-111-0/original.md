Time for another beta patch! Heads up that there won't be a patch on the 27th as our team is taking a break in the last week of August. As we'll explain a bit further in the upcoming August Neowsletter, there may be a longer wait in general for the next patch, as we've shifted our focus to some BIG, much-anticipated pieces of content!

In the meantime, let's look at some of this update's highlights. First off, there are a couple of card reworks and lots of various balance changes as well as UX and performance improvements. Also, we have officially implemented Indonesian localization! In the art and VFX realm, we've added some cool new card art and, excitingly, low HP idle animations for all of the playable characters! Now when you're close to death you'll at least have some fun visual flair to go along with it.
